	Nucleotides Sequence


A nucleotides sequence is a succession of letters that indicate the order of nucleotides within a DNA molecule. 

The letters are A, C, G, and T (adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymine) representing the four nucleotide bases of a DNA strand. 

Virus uses the protein from other organisms to copy itself and thus some kind of fault tolerance is needed. 

Some virus gets fault tolerance by keeping some of their DNA in a form such that it is identical when read in forward and reverse directions. 

 

For example, in the nucleotides sequence GGATCCCTACCT, the part that starts at the 3rd position (ATCCCTA) has such a property.
Given a nucleotides sequence of length N, write a program to find the position and the length of the longest part that is identical when read in forward and reverse directions.


Time limit: 3 seconds for 20 test cases. (java 6 seconds)

(If your program exceeds this time limit, the answers that have been already printed are ignored and the score becomes 0. 

So, it may be better to print a wrong answer when a specific test case might cause your program to exceed the time limit. One guide for the time limit excess would be the size of the input.)


 

[Input]
In each test case, the first line has an integer N, where N is the length of the nucleotides sequence. 3≤N≤1,000,000. Next line contains a string of length N which consists of characters A, C, G, and T.


[Output]
For each test case, you should print "Case #T" in the first line where T means the case number. 

The next line should output two integers, which represents the starting position and the length of the longest part which is identical when read in forward and reverse directions. 

If there is more than one such part, you should output the starting position of the longest part that comes first in the sequence.
